#PyCity School District Analysis

###Overview
The project is to clear the scores of students who are suspected to have conducted academic disloyalty and rerun the analysis to determine the updated scores. 

###Results
The removal of false scores only had a minor impact on the entire school district as the overall percentage of passing students of only 1%.

The falsified scores from students at Thomas High had a substantial impact on that school’s performance. The overall percentage dropped by 25% which removed Thomas High as one of the leading schools in performance.
